This is a bare bones example of a running game with Network Manager and UI prefab players\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Remove all scenes from Build Settings, then add the Example scene alone.
\item Open the Example scene and build the project.
\item In the editor, click Play, and Server + Client or Server Only...it will be listening on port 7777. ~\newline

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If you clicked Host (Server + Client), the host player will appear as Player 00.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Run one or more instances (up to 16 total players) of the built application.
\item Click Client on each instance.
\item Now you will see all players in the editor and the clients, all with data being updated and synchronized. 
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
