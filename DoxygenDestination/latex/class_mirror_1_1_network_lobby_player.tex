\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
This component works in conjunction with the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mirror_1_1_network_lobby_manager}{Network\+Lobby\+Manager}} to make up the multiplayer lobby system. 

The Lobby\+Prefab object of the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mirror_1_1_network_lobby_manager}{Network\+Lobby\+Manager}} must have this component on it. This component holds basic lobby player data required for the lobby to function. Game specific data for lobby players can be put in other components on the Lobby\+Prefab or in scripts derived from \mbox{\hyperlink{class_mirror_1_1_network_lobby_player}{Network\+Lobby\+Player}}.
