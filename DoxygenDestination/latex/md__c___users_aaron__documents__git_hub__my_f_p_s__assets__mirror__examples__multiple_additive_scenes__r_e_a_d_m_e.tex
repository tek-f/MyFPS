In Build Settings, remove all scenes and add both of the scenes from the Scenes folder in the following order\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Main
\item Game
\end{DoxyItemize}

Open the Main scene in the Editor and make sure the Game Scene field in the Multi\+Scene Network Manager on the Network scene object contains the Game scene. This is already setup by default, but if the Main scene was opened and saved before putting the scenes in the Build Settings list, the Game Scene field may be cleared accidentally.\hypertarget{md__c___users_aaron__documents__git_hub__my_f_p_s__assets__mirror__examples__multiple_additive_scenes__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysection{Multi\+Scene Network Manager}\label{md__c___users_aaron__documents__git_hub__my_f_p_s__assets__mirror__examples__multiple_additive_scenes__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md18}
The Multi\+Scene Network Manager is derived from the base Network Manager and is responsible for additively loading the subscene instances and placing the players in their respective subscene instances and initializing player Sync\+Vars. It has a Game Scene field where the Game subscene is assigned, and an Instances field to set how many instances are loaded on the server.

In this example, the subscene instances are additively loaded on the server with {\ttfamily local\+Physics\+Mode = Local\+Physics\+Mode.\+Physics3D}. Physics subscenes do not auto-\/simulate, so each scene has a game object with a generic {\ttfamily Physics\+Simulator} script on it. This script does nothing on the client, only on the server.

Clients only ever have one instance of the subscene additively loaded (without {\ttfamily local\+Physics\+Mode}), while server has them all. All networked objects have a {\ttfamily Network\+Scene\+Checker} component which is what isolates them to their specific subscene.\hypertarget{md__c___users_aaron__documents__git_hub__my_f_p_s__assets__mirror__examples__multiple_additive_scenes__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysection{Playing in the Instances}\label{md__c___users_aaron__documents__git_hub__my_f_p_s__assets__mirror__examples__multiple_additive_scenes__r_e_a_d_m_e_autotoc_md19}
